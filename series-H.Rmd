Answer all of the following questions. [4 $\times$ 5 = 20]


1. Using the `gapminder` data in the `gapminder` package, replicate the following plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder); library(tidyverse)
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
ggplot()+ 
  geom_bar(aes(reorder(country, (pop/100000)), (pop/100000)), stat = "identity")+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(x = "Asian countries",
       y = "Population per 100000") 

  
```


2. What is the average displacement of a manual car with 4 cylinders in the `mtcars` dataset in the base R `datasets` package?
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  filter(cyl == 4 & am == 1) %>% 
  summarise(mean(disp))
```


3. Tidy and replicate the `billboard` dataset in the `tidyr` package as given below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
billboard %>% 
  separate(col = date.entered,
           into = c("year", "month", "day"),
           convert = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(month == 1, year == 2000, day == 1)
```


4. Explain the following codes and their outputs.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
s <- 1:5
rating <- factor(s)

(rating <- factor(s, ordered = TRUE,
                levels = s))
```

2. In the file `GDP.xlsx` how many countries do not have data on GDP?
3. How does the number of cylinders `cyl` affect the mileage `mpg` for a given horsepower `hp`? Calculate the partial correlation in the `mtcars.xlsx` dataset.
4. Suppose that the firmâ€™s production function is $Q=F(K,L)=50K^{0.5}L^{0.5}$. Suppose, too, that the price of labour w=5 and the price of capital r=20. What is the cost minimising input bundle if the firm wants to produce 1,000 units per year?
