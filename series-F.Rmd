Answer all of the following questions. [4 $\times$ 5 = 20]



1. Using the `mpg` dataset in the `ggplot2` package, replicate the following plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```

2. Calculate the mean *mpg* (miles per gallon) of the  cars with 6 and 4 cylinders in `mtcars` dataset in the base R `datasets` package.
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg,cyl) %>% 
  filter(cyl %in% c(6,4)) %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(mean(mpg))
```


3. Tidy and replicate the `us_rent_income` dataset in the `tidyr` package as given below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
us_rent_income %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variable,
              values_from = estimate) %>% 
  filter(moe <= 3) %>% 
  arrange(rent)

```


4. Explain the following codes and their outputs.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
filter(gapminder, continent %in% c("Asia", "Africa"))
```

2. What is the average displacement of a manual car with 4 cylinders in the `mtcars.xlsx` dataset?
6. Rank (without ties) the countries according to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the `GDP.xlsx` dataset.
13. Suppose that the firmâ€™s production function is $Q=F(K,L)=50K^{0.5}L^{0.5}$. Suppose, too, that the price of labour w=5 and the price of capital r=20. What is the cost minimising input bundle if the firm wants to produce 1,000 units per year?
