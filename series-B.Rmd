Answer all of the following questions. [4 $\times$ 5 = 20]

1. Explain the following codes and their outputs.
```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
a1 <- 12; class(a1); length(a1)
names(a1) <- 'Number'; names(a1)
```

2. Using the `midwest` dataset in the `ggplot2` package, replicate the following plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
options(scipen = 999)
data(midwest)
midwest %>% 
  filter(poptotal >= 0 & poptotal <= 500000) %>% 
ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x = area,
                 y = poptotal,
                 col = state,
                 size = popdensity), 
             alpha = 0.5)
```

3. How many female humans are there in the `starwars` dataset in the `dplyr` package ?

  select(species, sex) %>% 
  count()
```

4. Tidy and replicate the `fish_encounters` dataset in the `tidyr` package as given below.
