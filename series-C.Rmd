Answer all of the following questions. [4 $\times$ 5 = 20]

1. Explain the following codes and their outputs.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
a2 <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
colnames(a2) <- c("A", "B", "C")

a2[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c("B", "A")]
```

2. In the `starwars` dataset in the `dplyr` package, which species has the most number of blue eye colour?
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
starwars %>% 
  filter(eye_color== "blue") %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  count()
```

3. Using the `iris` dataset in the base R `datasets` package, replicate the following plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(iris)+
  geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                 y = Sepal.Width,
                 shape = Species,
                 col = Species))
```

4. Tidy and replicate the `who` dataset in the `tidyr` package as given below.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
who %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65,
               names_to = "Diagnosis",
               values_to = "Value") %>% 
  filter(country == "India" & year == 2002) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Value))
```

2. Calculate the mean *mpg* (miles per gallon) of the  cars with 6 and 4 cylinders in `mtcars.xlsx` dataset?
3. How many missing values are there in total in the `GDP.xlsx` dataset? Find how many countries are listed in the data without using the filter option?
4. Suppose that the firmâ€™s production function is $Q=F(K,L)=50K^{0.5}L^{0.5}$. Suppose, too, that the price of labour w=5 and the price of capital r=20. What is the cost minimising input bundle if the firm wants to produce 1,000 units per year?
