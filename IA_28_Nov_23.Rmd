2. What is the average displacement of a manual car with 4 cylinders in the `mtcars.xlsx` dataset?
3. Calculate the mean *mpg* (miles per gallon) of the  cars with 6 and 4 cylinders in `mtcars.xlsx` dataset?
4. How many years of data are available for each country in the `GDP.xlsx` dataset? How many countries do not have data for all the years?
5. In the file `GDP.xlsx` how many countries do not have data on GDP?
